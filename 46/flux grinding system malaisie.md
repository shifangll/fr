## Welding Wikipedia
Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials,usually metals or thermoplastics,by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool causing fusion.Welding is distinct from lower temperature metal joining techniques such as brazing and soldering,which do not melt the base metal.In addition to melting the base metal,a filler material is typically.Avoidance of Thermal Damage in Grinding and Prediction of.Avoidance of Thermal Damage in Grinding and Prediction of the Damage Threshold W.B.Rowe (I),J.A.Pettit,A.Boyle and J.L.Moruzzi Received on January 15,1988 To achieve control of the grinding process it is necessary to predict the conditions at which thermal damage to the work piece sur'ace occurs.the position of the burn boundary.of the hent flux between the grinding wheel and the.

## newb question weld stainless to aluminized exhaust.
I am getting ready to fab up the exhaust on my project car.I plan on using aluminized pipe for the majority of the project.I am grinding off the coating for the weld area.I have no problem migging the thin metal,I have done 80% of all of my other welding on sheetmetal.I am running 75 25 on a mig welder.23 wire .Cutting with geometrically undefined cutting edges IIThermal heat flux in grinding Energy distribution and heat flow Thermal energy flows in all relevant components of system: Workpiece (q w) Grinding wheel (q s) Chip (q chip) Cooling lubricant (q Cool) The distribution of the heat flow can be manipulated Legend: P c ´´= cutting power F t = tangential force v c = cutting.
