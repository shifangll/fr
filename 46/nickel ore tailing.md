## Tailings.info What are tailings? Their nature and production
Tailings characteristics can vary greatly and are dependent on the ore mineralogy together with the physical and chemical processes used to extract the economic product.Ritcey (1989) reported that tailings of the same type may possess different mineralogy and therefore will have different physical and chemical characteristics.Nickel processing Extraction and refining BritannicaNickel processing Nickel processing Extraction and refining: The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper,and indeed,in a number of cases,similar processes and equipment are used.The major differences in equipment are the use of higher temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel.

A conventional tailings facility,designed to store water,can provide a mining operation with a buffer (e.g.storm water storage) to maintain operations during dry months of the year.Oxidation of sulphides in the tailings can create high concentrations (but low volume) of seepage water.May not be practical for some ore.Copper Nickel FlotationTo confirm the results of the batch testing and provide the cooperating company with a large sample of the cobalt nickel and copper lead concentrates for further experimentation,pilot plant flotation tests were made.The pilot plant was operated 24 hr a day,except for minor interruptions for repairs and disposal of tailing.
