## Ball Mills an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Ball Mill RETSCH powerful grinding and homogenizationBall mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.

## Introduction to Milling Tools and Their Application
Ball end mills produce a radius at the bottom of pockets and slots.Ball end mills are used for contour milling,shallow slotting,contour milling and pocketing applications.Flutes Spiral shaped cutting edges are cut into the side of the end mill to provide a path for chips to escape when an end mill.Rod mills,how they function Mine Engineer.ComRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
