## Dry processing Mineral Processing
There are a number of advantages for upgrading coal with dry jigging technology,most notably the lack of process water,which eliminates the need for fines dewatering and slurry confinement.Dry jigging eliminates the product moisture penalty associated with wet processing of thermal coals.Dry coal preparation without the use of water • STEINERTWith this method,the de centralised pre concentration of coal in small,remote mines allows the coal to be separated from the waste rock,to immense economic advantage.Transport costs are massively reduced,or the coal is sold directly as a high quality product.The use of drum screens is very common in coal beneficiation.

Coal is a combustible sedimentary rock formed from vegetation that has been consolidated between other rock strata and altered by the combined effects of pressure and heat over millions of years.Coal is composed primarily of carbon,and also contains varying amounts of other components,like hydrogen,oxygen,sulphur and other impurities.Beneficiation WikipediaIn the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().Examples of beneficiation processes include froth flotation and gravity separation.Other economic uses of the term are in use.
