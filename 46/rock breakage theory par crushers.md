## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Blast Fragmentation Appraisal Means to Improve Cost.Feb 25,2011 · Blast Fragmentation Appraisal Means to Improve Cost Effectiveness in Mines blasting.It is desirable to have a uniform fragment size distribution,avoiding both fines and oversizes.
