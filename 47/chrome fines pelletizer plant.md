## Estimating effect of chrome ore granulometry on sintered.
AbstractChromite ore pellets are used for ferrochrome production by the smelting reduction process.The strength and porosity of the sintered pellets play a significant role in smelting reduction.Granulometry of the chromite fines used for pellet production is an imperative enabler which controls the pellet strength and porosity by packing of particles and formation of bonds due to melting of.
