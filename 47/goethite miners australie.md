The opaque mineralogy of the open pit refractory ores is dominated by goethite that occurs mostly as pseudomorphic grains after pyritohedral pyrite crystals that average 200 250 μm across.Haematite occurs as bands within or as outer shells of the goethite grains.Additional goethite occurs locally as finer grained areas of exotic goethite.Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineralHematite is the world's most important ore of iron.Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process,hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world.Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.
