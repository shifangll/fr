## The operating principle of the ball mill
The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.Metso Ball MillsBall mills designed for long life and minimum maintenance Metso overflow ball mill sizes range from 5 ft.x 8 ft.with 75 HP to 30' x 41'.and as much as 30,000 HP.Larger ball mills are available with dual pinion or ring motor drives.Our mills incorporate many of the qualities which have made the Marcy name famous since 1913.
