## Planetary Ball Mills,Retsch® VWR
These ball mills pulverize and mix soft,medium hard,and extremely hard as well as brittle and fibrous materialsDesigned for rapid,high speed grinding of small samples,these mills utilize stainless steel or hard faced blades to successfully pulverize even the most difficult materials.These blades either pulse or provide continuous operation depending on the specific samples.Common & Basic Formulas for Mineral Processing CalculationsPulp Densities.Pulp densities indicate by means of a tabulation the percentages of solids (or liquid to solid ratio) in a sample of pulp.This figure is valuable in two ways—directly,because for each unit process and operation in milling the optimum pulp density must be established and maintained,and indirectly,because certain important tonnage calculations are based on pulp density.
