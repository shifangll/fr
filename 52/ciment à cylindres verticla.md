## Highway Live Loads on Concrete Pipe
Highway Live Loads on Concrete Pipe Foreword Thick,high strength pavements designed for heavy truck traffic substantially reduce the pressure transmitted through a wheel to the subgrade and,consequently,to the underlying concrete pipe.The pressure reduction is so great that generally the live load can be neglected.Reinforced Concrete Cylinder Pipe (AWWA C300) ForterraPrior to the early 1940s and the introduction of C301,Reinforced Concrete Cylinder Pipe (RCCP) was the most commonly used Concrete Pressure Pipe in the United States and Canada.RCCP (C300) is manufactured in accordance with the AWWA C300 Standard and is designed in accordance with the AWWA Manual M9.
