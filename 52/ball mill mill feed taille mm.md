Rod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (4 to 35 mesh).Mill (grinding) WikipediaBall mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.
