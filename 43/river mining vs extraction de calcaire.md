## Environmental impact of mining Wikipedia
Environmental impacts of mining can occur at local,regional,and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices.Impacts can result in erosion,sinkholes,loss of biodiversity,or the contamination of soil,groundwater,and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes.These processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have.Assessing impacts of mining: Recent contributions from GIS.1.Introduction.Mining is one of few industries that change entire landscapes,making it the source of a variety of impacts (see Bebbington et al.2008; Mudd,2010).These impacts are geographical in nature,as mines are unevenly distributed around the world and disproportionately affect the communities or ecosystems nearest to them (Sonter et al.2014).

## Sand Extraction: 1.Introduction GreenFacts
Introduction.Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction.In the preparation of concrete,for each tonne of cement,the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS,2013b).Thus,the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.Mining WikipediaMining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre historic times.Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies,analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine,extraction of the desired materials,and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.De Re Metallica,Georgius Agricola,1550,Book I,Para.1
