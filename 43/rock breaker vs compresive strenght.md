## How does Compressive Strength relate to Bearing Capacity.
The "unconfined" compressive strength is equal to 2 times the undrained shear strength.For all intents and purposes the ultimate bearing capacity is 6 times the undrained shear strength (where c in cNc is the undrained shear strength) or 3 times the unconfined compressive strength.CIP 35 Testing Compressive Strength of ConcreteCompressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens.A test result is the average of at least two standard cured strength specimens made from the same concrete sample and tested at the same age.In most cases strength requirements for concrete are at an age of 28 days.

## Compressive strength Wikipedia
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).In the study of strength of materials.ROCK STRENGTH,BRITTLENESS AND BLAST.2 Rock strength,brittleness and blast fragmentation 1 Introduction Knowing the size of the fragments produced during rock quarry blasting is of major engineering importance.If the rocks are to be used for some downstream operation (e.g.building a breakwater) then they need to t.
