## Goethite Bay Iron Ore Project (Labrador Trough) Altius
Goethite Bay Iron Ore Project (Labrador Trough) The Goethite Bay Project is located in the Labrador Trough,Canada's premier iron ore mining district.The project is ~22 km northeast of the Iron Ore Company of Canada's Carol Lake Mine and ~7 km northeast of the undeveloped Julienne Lake deposit.Briquetting Conditions for Australian Hematite Goethite.goethite iron ore fines are exported from Australia as they are technically challenging to agglomerate.Development of a process to produce a pre agglomerated calcined product would significantly increase the value of Australian iron ore exports and reduce the energy costs associated with transport.

## Iron
Iron (Fe) is the most abundant element,but it only comprises approximately 6 percent of continental crust.Metallic iron is silvery white,malleable,ductile,and may be readily magnetized.Elemental iron has a relatively high specific gravity (7.87) and high melting point.Iron is used primarily in the manufacture of iron and steel products.A Brief History of Mining in Michigan's Marquette and.of iron minerals including hematite and goethite.Iron ore was priced by iron content with a dried shipping grade of 57 64% being typical.The price per ton was reduced by penalties for higher amounts of impurities such as phosphorous and sulfur which are unacceptable for Bessemer steel making.

## Goethite Uses
Hydrated iron oxide,goethite,is a mineral located in soil and environment,that is low in temperature,and contributes to the main constituents of rust.With hardness ranging between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Mohs scale,its chemical formula is Fe 3+ O(OH) or HFeO 2.Its color texture varies from yellowish brown to red,making it the source for pigments such as the yellow ocher.
