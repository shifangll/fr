## Rolling Mills Industrial Efficiency Technology & Measures
In rolling mills,intermediate steel products are given their final shape and dimension in a series of shaping and finishing operations.Most of the slabs are heated in reheating furnaces and rolled into final shape in hot or cold rolling or finishing mills.While some products (e.g.reinforcement bars,steel plates) only require hot rolling,some others may require both hot and cold.ROLLING ABB's technology to modernise Alunorf's cold.ABB's technology to modernise Alunorf's cold rolling mill ROLLING aluminiumtoday January February 2017 Aluminium International Today Aluminium Norf GmbH chose ABB to modernise the automation and technical equipment at their KW5
