## Bond Work Index Procedure and Method
This Grindability Test or Bond Ball Mill Work Index Procedure is used to determine the Bond Work Index of minus six mesh or finer feed ore samples.These equation application methods are used to processOperational work index for grinding plants ScienceDirectThe on line calculation of either the rod mill operational work index or the overall plant operational work index Wiog requires the feed size fso,which is not measured on line.A sensitivity analysis is made to assess the influence of fso and Pso in the determination of the work index.
