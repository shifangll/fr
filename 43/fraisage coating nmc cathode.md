## Al2O3 coated LiCoO2 as cathode material for lithium ion.
If the cathode material is exposed to the electrolyte,the strong oxidizing Co 4+ cations will react with the electrolyte and lead to capacity loss.Obviously coating the surface of LiCoO 2 with inert and stable Al 2 O 3 can prevent Co 4+ from direct contact with the electrolyte and decrease the capacity loss.Cast Electrode Sheets for Li ion Batteries NEI CorporationNEI offers a variety of cathode and anode electrode sheets that are suitable for a wide range of applications.Standard electrode sheets are cast on 5 inch x 10 inch (12.7 cm x 25.4 cm) sheets of copper (anode) or aluminum (cathode) foil current collectors,single.
