## DC motor Wikipedia
A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical machines that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields.Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism,either electromechanical or electronic,to periodically change the direction of current flow in part of the motor.Commutator (electric) WikipediaA commutator is a rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit.It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine.Two or more electrical contacts called "brushes" made of a soft conductive material.

## Construction and Principle of Operation of the Shunt DC Motor
The DC Shunt wound motor,running on Direct current,has its field windings placed in parallel to the armature.In Electrical terms,parallel is generally denoted as shunt.That is the reason behind naming it a DC Shunt motor.Same voltage is applied to both shunt winding and armature in this motor.This parallel configuration allows independent path of current for field winding and armature.Direct Current Motor Basics DC machines Electrical.The first type of motor built is still in widespread use In the late 1800s,several inventors built the first working motors,which used direct current (DC) power.After the invention of the induction motor,alternating current (AC) machines largely replaced DC machines in most applications.However,DC motors still have many uses.DC motor principles.
