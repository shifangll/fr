## Cost to build a gravel driveway Estimates and Prices at Fixr
How much does it cost to build a gravel driveway? Regardless of whether a driveway is only a large square upon which vehicles are parked,or if it is a lengthy pathway that covers more than a few hundred feet,it will have to be adequately prepared if it will last and give good service One of the most common ways to prepare the driveway is to pour a thick layer of gravel over the entire surfaceCALCULATING BASE MATERIALS SQUARE FOOT AREA.As illustrated at the right it's simply a matter of taking the height at the tallest point and the width at the base of the triangle and then multiplying those by half.So in this case the formula you need is: Area = 0.5 x Width x Height.Height In Feet Width In Feet Total Square Feet.
