## Standard Operating Procedure Standard Polisher Grinder
Standard Operating Procedure Standard Polisher Grinder.contact the laboratory's manager or the laboratory' s safety coordinator.The names,office numbers.make sure any spilled water is cleaned up before you start using the polisher grinder.C Mechanical: the polishing grinding wheel spin at speeds up to 1200 rpm.This presents two14 Weathering and Erosionweathering: mechanical weathering and chemical weathering.Each type of weathering has different effects on rock.Mechanical Weathering The process by which rock is broken down into smaller pieces by physical means is mechanical weathering.Mechanical weath ering is strictly a physical process and does not change the compo sition of the rock.

## Rock Mechanics Laboratory NTNU
Knowledge about the mechanical properties of rocks is crucial for all construction work in rock mass.The rock mechanics laboratory performs a number of standardized tests,as well as special assignments.Since 1964,the laboratory has performed in situ rock stress measurement.This activity is currently managed by SINTEF Building and.ELE International Rock Mechanics testing equipmentGrinding.Rock mechanics is the part of geotechnical engineering that studies the behaviour of rocks under variable physical and environmental conditions.Testing is undertaken to enable the prevention of geotechnical failure such as shearing,by measuring the behaviour of rocks for compliance with regulations,design specifications and quality.
