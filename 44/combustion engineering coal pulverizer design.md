## Utility Boiler Operations & Maintenance Seminar
The seminar is designed specifically for utilities using pulverized coal as a primary fuel source.Covered in the course are boiler and boiler component design,safety,inspection,maintenance,firing systems and pulverizers,and methods for overall increased boiler availability and reliability.Types of Boiler Coal Pulverizers Bright Hub EngineeringThermal power plants use different types of coal pulverizers.The method used is attrition,impact,or a combination of both.This article explains the characteristics of the three main types attrition,impact and attrition,and impact or hammer.Selection of the type of pulverizer depends on the grindability of the coal,the capital costs and maintenance costs,and considerations for licensing.
