## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum.
Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum.The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process.In the Bayer Process,the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide,which leaches aluminum from the bauxite.Aluminum Minerals Education CoalitionAluminum is the most abundant metal element in the Earth's crust.Bauxite ore is the main source of aluminum and contains the aluminum minerals gibbsite,boehmite,and diaspore.Aluminum is used in the United States in packaging,transportation,and building.Because it is a mixture of minerals,bauxite itself is a rock,not a mineral.

High Alumina Bauxite also called bauxite aggregate,its composition is very complex,and the general term of Hydrous Alumina Ore with different geological origin.Such as boehmite,diaspore and gibbsite (Al2O3 3H2O); some are diaspore and kaolinite (2SiO2 Al2O3 2H2O) Company; some kaolinite,and with the increase of the content of kaolinite,which is generally the bauxite or kaolinite clay.Refractory Grade BauxiteThe mining of crude refractory grade bauxite consists of the same methods and procedures that are customarily applied to the extraction of metallurgical grade bauxite ores.In fact,in some cases,special quality grades of bauxite are selectively mined simultaneously with associated metallurgical ore.

To handle,dispose of,and reuse red mud appropriately,its chemical and mineralogical compositions should be known.In general,the chemical and mineralogical compositions of red mud are complex and depend on the type (gibbsite boehmite diaspore) and grade (Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 ratio) of bauxite ore and the production processes used to extract.The Bauxite IndexBauxite deposits are commonly referred to by a number of different terminologies relating to either their mineralogy or geological formation.Alternately they may be described by likening them to other well known deposits elsewhere around the globe.

## Uses of Bauxite Definition,Different Applications & Formula
Bauxite ore is soft and red clay,rich in alumina,and its name originates from Les Baux de Provence,It was a French geologist Pierre Berthier who first discovered bauxite near a village southern France in 1821.Later,a French chemist named Henri Sainte Claire Deville officially termed the substance as "bauxite" in 1861.US3925257A Sulfur recovery catalyst and production.Ground calcined bauxite ore fines are dry mixed with powdered colloidal boehmite alumina (alpha alumina monohydrate).The mixture is moistened with a solution of an acid capable of peptizing the boehmite alumina and formed into particles by extrusion.The particles are then dried and calcined.

Unlike the base metal ores,bauxite does not require complex processing because most of the bauxite mined is of an acceptable grade.Ore quality can be improved by relatively simple and inexpensive processes for removing clay,known as "beneficiation",which include washing,wet screening and mechanical or manual sorting.The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican BauxiteIn October,1943,Alcan was incorporated under the name Jamaica Bauxites Limited as a Jamaican company to investigate the commercial potential of Jamaican bauxite.In the same year,2500 tonnes of ore was shipped to the USA for process investigation and it was realised that the bauxite was suitable for processing using Bayer technology.

Bauxite ResourcesWhat is Bauxite? Bauxite is ore from which aluminium can be extracted.Most bauxite,including Australian bauxites are lateritic,formed by intense weathering of various rock formations.The alumina in lateritic bauxite is mainly in the form of gibbsite,an aluminium oxide trihydrate.

## Bauxite Geoscience Australia
Bauxite is a heterogeneous,naturally occurring material of varying composition that is relatively rich in aluminium.The principal minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 2 O 3.3H 2 O),boehmite (Al 2 O 3.H 2 O) and diaspore,which has the same composition as boehmite,but is denser and harder.Bauxite AMRBauxite is a rock rich in alumina resulting from the processing of silicate initially contained in the eruptive rocks (eg feldspar) or sedimentary rocks (clays),hydroxides,such as gibbsite (tri hydrate),boehmite or diaspore (mono hydrate),and oxide such as corundum.
