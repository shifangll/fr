## Talc Mineral Production Formation of Talc Golcha Minerals
Talc is basically a mineral which belongs to the class of silicates.The formation of talc is achieved when the carbonate sediments undergo through contact metamorphosis.It is also formed when the magmatic rocks which are rich in magnesium undergoes the hydrothermal alteration.The rocks which contain talc are metamorphic in nature and therefore talc is produced as secondary mineral.Mineral description : TalcA common mineral in Sweden.Falu mine.Svartviksgruvan,Svärdsjö,Kopparbergs län.(over 20 000 tons mined) Garpenbergsgruvan,Kopparbergs län.Major part of the soapstone (täljsten) occurance along the caledonides.As Handöl and Lermon,Jämtland.Laisholm,Hemavan,Västerbotten.As light green veins in soapstone witm dolomite crystals.
