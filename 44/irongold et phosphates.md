## Silver phosphate Wikipedia
Silver phosphate is formed as a yellow precipitate by the reaction between a soluble silver compound,such as silver nitrate with a soluble orthophosphate; its solubility product is 8.89×10 −17 mol 4 dm −12.The precipitation reaction is analytically significant and can be used in qualitative or quantitative tests for phosphates.Alchemical symbol WikipediaAlchemical symbols,originally devised as part of alchemy,were used to denote some elements and some compounds until the 18th century.Although notation like this was mostly standardized,style and symbol varied between alchemists,so this page lists the most common.
