## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Recyclone® MH ACSystemsRecyclone® MH.In order to obtain higher efficiencies and compliance with emission limits,an improved recirculation system has been designed to take advantage of the Hurricane cyclones.A mechanical ReCyclone® (ReCyclone® MH) is made up of a Hurricane and a particle separator (straight through cyclone),placed downstream of the cyclone called the "recirculator".

## Hydrocyclone Wikipedia
A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.What Does A Cyclone Do In The Gold Mining ProcessWhat Does A Cyclone Do In The Gold Mining Process.In mineral processing,hydrocyclones are used extensively both to classify.Read more.Mineral processing Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.The process of panning and sifting for gold uses both of these methods.Mineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation.
