## Crusher Wikipedia
A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant.Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening.Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing.Model 4140 Gyratory Compactor Troxler LabsThe Model 4140 Gyratory Compactor includes the electrical and mechanical parts necessary to continuously compact hot mix asphalt.Use Figure 1 2 to locate and identify the following parts: 1.The power switch is located under the worktable.2.The control unit,located on.
