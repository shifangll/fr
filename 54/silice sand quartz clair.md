## Silica sand
If the particular sand deposit contains almost nothing but quartz,we often call it a silica sand.Such sand deposits are said to be mature because other rock forming minerals are already broken down by the weathering process leaving only the super resistant quartz as a residue.Silica sand is a mineral resource.It is mined mostly for glass.SAFETY DATA SHEET (SDS) ALL PURPOSE SANDSAFETY DATA SHEET (SDS): ALL PURPOSE SAND.SECTION I IDENTIFICATION.PRODUCT IDENTIFIER TRADE NAME OTHER SYNONYMS All Purpose Sand Sand Play Sand,Silica Sand,Quartz Sand,Concrete Sand,Blended Sand,Mason Sand,Asphalt Sand,Filter Media,Foundry Sand,Golf Course Sand,Golf Sand.RECOMMENDED USE AND RESTRICTION ON USE
