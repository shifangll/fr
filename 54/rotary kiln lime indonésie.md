The rotation of the kiln,along with gravity,works the lime mud down toward the burner at the far downhill end of the kiln.The final product exiting the lime recovery kiln is calcium oxide,which undergoes a number of other chemical treatments before being used to regenerate white pulping liquor.Lime recovery kilns can be as long as 380 feet.Rotary Kilns KHD InternationalKiln plants with two and three station rotary kilns from KHD Humboldt Wedag are top of the line.One reason: highly efficient precalcining systems,which were developed by KHD Humboldt Wedag,revolutionizing the clinkering process.Rotary kilns no longer have to function as calciners which mean that they can be substantially smaller in size.

## Challenges for refractories in rotary kilns
As rotary kilns age,the steel shell in the discharge area can weaken and deform,causing brick constructions,including dams,to become unstable and loosen.Lime kilns,especially in the paper industry,can use more complex constructions to incorporate grates.Calcination of Refractory Raw Materials in different Kilns.Almost all refractory raw materials can be calcined in a rotary kiln although the loss of material for a softer raw material like fireclay will be higher in that kiln.In case of high temperature calcination as required for magnesite,which is also done in shaft kilns,but again rotary kiln is the best.

## Lime Production: Industry Profile
Lime kilns can be categorized into three groups: rotary kilns,vertical kilns,and miscellaneous.About 90 percent of commercial lime capacity in the U.S.is calcined in rotary kilns.Most of the remaining capacity is processed with vertical kilns (vertical kilns are more common in captive supply facilities),and small quantities are processed.Rotary Kiln an overview ScienceDirect TopicsA.A Boateng,in Rotary Kilns (Second Edition),2016.1.1 The Rotary Kiln Evolution.Rotary kilns have been synonymous with cement and lime kilns probably because of the history of their evolution and development.It has been reported that cement deposits characterized by Israeli geologists in the 1960s and the 1970s place cement making at 12,000,000 BC when reactions between limestone and oil.
