Foundation elements are most commonly constructed of reinforced concrete.As compared to the design of concrete elements that form the superstructure of a building,additional consideration must be given to concrete foundation elements due to permanent exposure to potentially deleterious materials,less precise construction tolerances and even the possibility of unintentional mixing with soil.CRC Press Online Series: Modern Concrete TechnologyHigh Performance Concrete 1st Edition.Pierre Claude Aïtcin July 02,1998.A complete review of the fast developing topic of high performance concrete (HPC) by one of the leading researchers in the field.It covers all aspects of HPC from materials,properties and technology,to construction and testing.
