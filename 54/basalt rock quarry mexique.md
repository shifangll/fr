## The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals
The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.Therefore,these numbers translate directly to g cm 3,or tonnes per cubic meter (t m 3).Missouri Traprock Missouri Department of Natural ResourcesAn aggregate is defined as a mass or body of rock particles,mineral grains or a mixture of both.Geologists consider traprock to be any dark colored,fine grained,nongranitic,hypabyssal or extrusive igneous rock,such as basalt,peridotite,diabase or fine grained gabbro.
