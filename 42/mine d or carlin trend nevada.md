## Gold mining in Nevada Wikipedia
It was not until 1961 that Newmont Mining Corporation discovered the large low grade gold deposit at Carlin that the mining industry began to take notice.The Carlin mine began producing gold in 1965,but at a gold price of US 35 per troy ounce,ore grades were still too low to cause a rush to northern Nevada.Gold mining in Nevada WikipediaThe trend surpassed 50,000,000 troy ounces (1,600 t) of gold in 2002.The Carlin and other mines along the trend pioneered the method of open pit mining with cyanide heap leach recovery that is today used at large low grade gold mines worldwide.New ore deposits are still being discovered and developed along the trend.
