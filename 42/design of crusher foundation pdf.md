## Dynamic Characteristics of Crusher Supporting Structures
therefore,to design crusher foundations for a certain expected number of hammers breaking from the critical locations of the suspensions.Codal Provisions According to the Indian Standard IS: 2974 (Part IV),the maximum dynamic force may be considered the most critical of the following three causes:DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A HORIZONTAL SHAFT IMPACT.basically of three types namely Cone crusher,Jaw crusher and Impact crusher.Our objective is to design various components of an Impact crusher like drive mechanism,shaft,rotor,hammers,casing,and discharge mechanism which will be useful in minimizing weight,cost and maximizing the capacity and also do their analysis.

Figure 5.1 Schematic diagram of a crusher showingg the open and closed side settings.5.1 Jaw and Gyratory Crushers.Jaw and gyratory crushers are used mostly for primary crushing.They are characterized by wide gape and narrow discharge and are designed to handle large quantities of material.The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size.Crusher WikipediaThe Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher.

This design restricts the feeding of the crusher to one side only.Another prime consideration is the space that each takes up.The Jaw crusher tends to end up working underground because of its smaller size and its single feed point.The Jaw crusher gets its name from the type of crushing surface used.This surface is literally two jaws.STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF ROADS.U.S.Customary units of measure are used in the FP 14 as provided in the November 25,2008 Memorandum from Jeffrey F.Paniati entitled Update on Metric Use Requirements for FHWA Documents
