## Ball mill Wikipedia
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.Roller Mill Maintenance00 CPMRoller mills are also more sensitive to instantaneous changes in the feed rate than are other pieces of process equipment.Feeding a roller mill directly from a screw conveyor or bucket elevator will cause surges in the feed rate that the roller mill "sees" instantaneously unless some damping system such as a surge hopper is used.

In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.Dipl. Ing.Th.Fahrland,Dr. Ing.K. H.Zysk,Loesche GmbH.There is no question that vertical roller mills like the Loesche Mill offer significant advantages over ball mills in terms of their energy efficiency.As noted in a current publication (1) the specific power consumption of a ball mill is higher than that of a vertical roller mill (VRM) carrying out the same oper
