## Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans: Trends in Microbiology
Dec 15,2018 · Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is by far the most widely studied of all extremely acidophilic prokaryotes.While it is found in many types of natural low pH environments in a variety of geoclimatic contexts,it has been more widely cited in anthropogenic (mostly mine impacted) environments.It is responsible for accelerating the oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals,causing the generation.Genes Free Full Text In a quest for engineering.Biomining with acidophilic microorganisms has been used at commercial scale for the extraction of metals from various sulfide ores.With metal demand and energy prices on the rise and the concurrent decline in quality and availability of mineral resources,there is an increasing interest in applying biomining technology,in particular for leaching metals from low grade minerals and wastes.

## Acidophilic actinomycetes from rhizosphere soil: diversity.
Three hundred and fifty one isolates of actinomycetes were recovered from 21 rhizospheric soil samples using acidified media of pH 5.5.They were evaluated for their antifungal,siderophore production and phosphate solubilization activities.The total count of actinomycetes growing on acidified starch casein agar and Gause no.1 agar were below 2.48 × 104 CFU g−1 soil.Acidophilic bacteria and archaea: acid stable biocatalysts.Nov 13,2011 · Abstract.Acidophiles are ecologically and economically important group of microorganisms,which thrive in acidic natural (solfataric fields,sulfuric pools) as well as artificial man made (areas associated with human activities such as mining of coal and metal ores) environments.
