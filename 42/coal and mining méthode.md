## Mining Method Selection EduMine
UBC Mining Method Selection (see Appendix II Mining Method References) is a modified version of the Nicholas approach for selection of mining method based on orebody characteristice (refer Nicholas 1981).Selection involves summation and ranking of numerical values associated with orebody characteristics that reflect the suitability of a particular method.
