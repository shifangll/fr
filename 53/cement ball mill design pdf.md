## The cement mill
Cement manufacturing brief description of a cement mill.Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill.This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls.As the drum rotates,the motion of the balls crushes the clinker.The drum.Dipl. Ing.Th.Fahrland,Dr. Ing.K. H.Zysk,Loesche GmbH.terial present in the ball mill cement,which in turn reflects the greater number of impacts and the inherent inefficiency of ball mill grinding.In more general terms,a typical particle size distribution for a ball mill system in closed circuit operation with a high efficiency,third generation classifier would be between 0.75 and 0.98.
