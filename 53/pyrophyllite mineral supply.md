## Pyrophyllite ( aka Desert talc) Clay and Glaze Chemistry.
Two different minerals with similar physical properties are talc and pyrophyllite.Their physical properties are nearly identical.Both are very soft: talc is the softest mineral on the Moh's hardness scale at 1,and pyrophyllite is 1 to 2.Both talc and pyrophyllite have perfect cleavage in one direction.This means that these minerals break into thin sheets.Pyrophyllite Mineral Collecting,Localities,Mineral.9.7 x 6.8 x 3.3 cm.A 4.0 cm,striking,radial starburst of pearlescent,pastel yellow green pyrophyllite blades is the centerpiece of this rich and fine specimen of solid pyrophyllite,which includes the blades,knobby crystal aggregates and massive pyrophyllite.
