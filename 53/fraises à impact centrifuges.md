## Centrifuge separation effect on bacterial indicator.
The centrifuge speeds higher than 2000 × g tested in this study yielded less than 10% reduction in solids content compared to the 2000 × g speed conditions.The centrifuge speeds of 8000 × g and 10,000 × g had no additional effect on solids reduction relative to the 6000 × g conditions.Decanter Centrifuge Aipu Solids ControlDecanter centrifuge is the 4th solids control equipment in whole drilling mud system It is used to process drilling mud discharged from desilter cones or mud cleaner Separation point of decanter centrifuge is as fine as 2~7 microns.

## Centrifuge Wikipedia
A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle),applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong.The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle,where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction.The impact of the centrifuge characteristics and.the impact of the centrifuge characteristics on the cell and fibrin architecture of a L PRF clot and membrane.The second objective of this article was to evaluate how changing some parameters of the L PRF protocol may influence its biological signature,independently from the characteristics of the centrifuge.Keywords
