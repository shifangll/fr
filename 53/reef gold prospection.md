A "reef" is another term for a vein of some mineral or ore,and has nothing to do with biological reefs,such as coral reefs.Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust,and most quartz veins do not carry gold,but those that have gold are avidly hunted by prospectors.Lode or Reef ProspectingIn searching for payable lodes,whether of gold,silver,copper,or even tin in some forms of occurrence,the indications are often very similar.The first prospecting is usually done on the hilltops or ridges,because,owing to denudation by ice or water which have bared the bedrock,the outcrops are there more exposed,and thence the lodes are followed down through the alluvial covered.
