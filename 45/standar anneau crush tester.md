## Ring Crush Test Determining the Ring Crush Strength
This test is performed according to ISO 12192 and TAPPI T 822.The ring crush test is similar to the short span compression test in that the strength of the liner or fluting is measured both in the machine direction and perpendicular to it.It is important that force application to the specimen is exactly perpendicular during these tests.Edge Crush Test Westpak Excellence in TestingThe Edge Crush Test (ECT),conducted according to TAPPI T 838 and similar,is a means to determine the ability of corrugated paperboard to withstand a top load when it is fabricated into a corrugated shipping container.The test involves carefully cutting a sample of material and subjecting it to a top load in the edge down configuration.
