## Calcium Carbonate an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The solubility of calcium carbonate in water is very low,e.g.below 1 gram per litre at 20 °C under 1 atmosphere CO 2 pressure.Its solubility is strongly influenced by partial pressure of CO 2,temperature,and concentration of other salts in solution.Changes in super saturation and hence precipitation and scaling usually occur as a result of temperature increase or pressure decrease.Calcium Carbonate Compounding Pelletizing Plant Genius.Dec 20,2015 · Specializes in CALCIUM CARBONATE (CACO3) COMPOUNDING Pelletizing Plant,GENIUS MACHINERY CO.LTD.was established in 1992,professional in CALCIUM CARBONATE (CACO3) COMPOUNDING Pelletizing Plant.
