Seems like it would save a heap in concrete costs (although i on't know how much the styrofoam would be).John.

## What is the foam concrete ?? And where can I use it.
Foam concrete is a cement material manufactured by mixing a cement paste,also called slurry,or mortar with a manufactured foam material.This makes a substance that is porous and lightweight.The volume of slurry to foam in the mixture dictates the density of the final product and how it will be used.Concrete Forms EPS & Styrofoam Blocks,Sheets,Panels.EPS Foam used to Seal a Cylinder for a Concrete Pour.EPS (expanded polystyrene),often referred to as Styrofoam,can be cut into almost any shape and size.For this project in Austin Texas,the contractor had 50 pipes that needed to have the ends protected during installation of concrete.The pipes were cut at a 45 degree angle.
