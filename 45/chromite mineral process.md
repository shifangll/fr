Chromite,an oxide of iron,magnesium,aluminum,and chromium,is the only ore mineral of chromium.In nature,chromite deposits are generally of two major types: stratiform (layered) and podiform (pod shaped).Both types are associated with ultramafic igneous rocks.The world's largest stratiform chromite deposits are found in South Africa,in.Ore genesis WikipediaThis sulfide mineral (usually pentlandite,pyrite,chalcopyrite,or pyrrhotite) gains platinum by mixing with the bulk of the magma because platinum is chalcophile and is concentrated in sulfides.Alternatively,platinum occurs in association with chromite either within the chromite mineral itself or within sulfides associated with it.
