## Cone Crusher Design
When the Symons brothers invented the cone crusher over 60 years ago,they employed the principle wherein the length of the crushing stroke was related to the free fall of material by gravity.This permitted the material being crushed to fall vertically in the crushing chamber; and in effect caused the particles to be crushed in a series of steps or stages as the particles got smaller due to.Cone Crushers McLanahanCone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.
