## How do pyrite and pyrrhotite damage building foundations.
Pyrite and pyrrhotite are minerals known as iron sulfides.When iron sulfides are exposed to water and oxygen,a series of chemical reactions breaks down the iron sulfides and forms new minerals called sulfates.These sulfates take up more space than the original iron sulfides.As they grow,the new sulfate minerals push against the surrounding rock,causing it to swell and crack.Major Mines & Projects Mazowe MinePyrite is the dominant sulfide (>95% of the ore minerals).It occurs in the form of massive and layered ores,of which both fine (grain diameters50 mm) and coarse grained (mm size) varieties are present.The pyrite grains are compact,homogeneous,and idiomorphic to hypidiomorphic in shape.They usually form aggregates that are locally fractured.
