## University of Minnesota's Mineral Pages: Pyrite
As water moves through a pyrite bearing rock,the pyrite's iron component may be oxidized,releasing its sulfur to form sulfuric acid.In natural settings this is seldom a concern,but pyrite rich waste from mining operations can significantly increase the acidity of surface waters.Role of pyrite in formation of hydroxyl radicals in coal.The prevalence of lung disease varies by mining region and may,in part,be related to regional differences in the bioavailable iron content of the coal.Pyrite (FeS 2),a common inorganic component in coal,has been shown to spontaneously form reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e.hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) and degrade nucleic.
