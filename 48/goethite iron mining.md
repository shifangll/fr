## Goethite classification,distribution and properties with.
The importance of goethite to Australian iron ore production is steadily increasing as the proportion of goethite rich,martite goethite bedded and channel iron deposits increases at the expense of declining production from high grade microplaty hematite deposits.For this reason,an improved understanding of goethite in iron deposits,its genesis,goethite types and their physical and.Goethite mineral information and dataNamed to honor German poet,dramatist,and philosopher,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.Goethite is a common mineral that forms as a product of the weathering of iron bearing minerals oxygen rich environments and is a component of iron ore,and it is a precipitate in hydrothermal,marine,and bog environments in reduced iron waters.

## Iron ore Wikipedia
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of high grade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lower grade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.Goethite Mineral Physical Optical Properties,Uses.Goethite is an iron oxide hydroxide,although manganese can substitute for up to 5 percent of the iron.It forms as a weathering product in the oxidation zones of veins of iron minerals,such as pyrite,magnetite and siderite.Goethite may occur with these minerals in the gossan,or iron hat,which is the weathered capping of an iron ore deposit.
