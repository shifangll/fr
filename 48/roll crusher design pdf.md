## TECHNICAL NOTES 5 CRUSHERS Mineral Tech
Figure 5.1 Schematic diagram of a crusher showingg the open and closed side settings.5.1 Jaw and Gyratory Crushers.Jaw and gyratory crushers are used mostly for primary crushing.They are characterized by wide gape and narrow discharge and are designed to handle large quantities of material.The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size.Double Roll Crusher Bevcon Wayors Bulk Made SimpleBevcon toothed double roll crushers are equipped with two identical crushing rolls rotates towards each other.These crushers are ideal at different stages of crushing primarily envisaged to generate very less fines.Hence the crushing ratios are limited to 4 :1.Since both rolls rotate in same speed,there is no relative motion between roll surfaces.
