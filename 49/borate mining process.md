## Borax The Chemical Company
TCC's borax,also known as sodium,sodium tetraborate,or disodium tetraborate,is an important boron compound,a mineral,and the salt of boric acid.It is usually a white powder consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water.Borax has a wide variety of uses.It is a component of many detergents,cosmetics,and enamel glazes.ITP Mining: Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S.Mining Industry Forms of Borates Borates are defined by industry as compounds that contain or supply boric oxide [B(OH)3].A large number of materials contain boric oxide,but the three most common borate containing minerals are tincal,ulexite,and colemanite.Kernite is the metamorphic

Borax WikipediaIn artisanal gold mining,borax is sometimes used as part of a process (as a flux) meant to eliminate the need for toxic mercury in the gold exThe Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small Scale Miners.Negative effects included the potential for eye irritation when borax was not handled properly,but even this effect was mild and short term.11.The borax technique spread to fellow miners and presently around 15,000 SSM in a small area of Luzon,the main island in the northern portion of the Philippines,use this method exclusively.

## The Pantanal Safari: Borax in Gold Mining?
Mar 14,2014 · Borax (Sodium Borate) is an inexpensive chemical commonly used in cleaning products like detergents.Because it is inexpensive,it makes a good alternative to mercury in the gold mining process because impoverished small scale miners have access to it.Gold Smelting & Refining ProcessThe flux is a mixture of several reagent chemical such as borax,silica,sodium nitrate,sodium carbonate and fluorspar.Borax is a white crystalline mineral used in glass and ceramic enamel mixes.In the smelting process,borax helps to reduce the gold smelting point of the charge and capture metallic oxides.The addition of this reagent must.

## Borax: The mineral Borax information and pictures
Borax occurs in arid regions,forming from evaporation of saline lakes.Borax is also synthetically formed as a by product of mining operations of borate deposits,and most of the specimens from the famous mine at Boron,California,are formed this way.The first Borax specimens came several dry lake deposits in Tibet.They were shipped in large quantities by ancient caravans for profit.Refining BoraxHistorically,American borate mining can be divided into three phases: playa surface mining (1860 1890),underground mining (1890 1957),and open pit mining (1957 present).The first phase gorged on surface deposits of those borates which were easiest to process,the second devoured large,concentrated subsurface deposits,and the third is
