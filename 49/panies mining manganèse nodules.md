## The Manganese nodules Marine Benthic Ecology.
Apr 30,2018 · Manganese nodules also include rare metals such as Gold and Platinum as well as rare earth metals of vital importance to the technology and renewable energy sectors.The story of the polymetallic nodules,a.k.a.manganese nodules started.The Clarion Clipperton Zone The Pew Charitable TrustsDec 15,2017 · The Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) spans 4.5 million square kilometers (1.7 million square miles) between Hawaii and Mexico,an abyssal plain as wide as the continental United States and punctuated by seamounts.Lying atop the muddy bottom or embedded just beneath it are trillions of potato size polymetallic nodules.These rocklike deposits contain nickel,manganese,copper,zinc.

## Manganese nodules « World Ocean Review
The mining,pumping and cleaning of the manganese nodules creates noise and vibrations,which disturb marine mammals such as dolphins,and could force them to flee from their natural area.The sediment laden water produced by the cleaning of manganese nodules is released into the sea from the ships.A sediment cloud is also created here.Manganese Nodule an overview ScienceDirect TopicsManganese nodules,together with micronodules and encrustations,are ferromanganese oxide deposits which contain variable amounts of other elements (Table 1).They occur throughout the oceans,although the economically interesting varieties have a much more restricted distribution.Manganese nodules are spherical to oblate in shape and range in size from less than 1 cm in diameter up to 10 cm.
