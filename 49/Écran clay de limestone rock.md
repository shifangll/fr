## Lab Activity on Sedimentary and Metamorphic Rocks
1.Identify five types of sedimentary rocks: conglomerate,sandstone,mudstone,limestone,and rock salt.2.Identify some minerals in sedimentary rocks,especially quartz,clay,calcite,halite,and iron oxides.3.Examine a sample of any of these rock types and tell the "story" of how it formed.4.Soils & Geology in Construction from Construction.Metamorphic rocks are formed from existing igneous,sedimentary or metamorphic rocks by heat and pressure below the earth's surface.The forming of igneous and metamorphic rock may reverse itself.For example,limestone,a sedimentary rock,can be changed to marble,a metamorphic rock,by heat and pressure below the earth's surface.
