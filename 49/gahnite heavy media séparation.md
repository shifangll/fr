## How it works protec protec SEPARATION PLANTS BY SINK
According to the application,a suspension of powdered Ferrosilicon or Magnetite in water is used as fluid heavy media in order to allow the separation.To obtain a heavy media with the specific gravity most suitable for the separation,it is necessary to increase or decrease the concentration of Ferrosilicon or Magnetite dispersed in water.Heavy Media Gravity Separation Mine Engineer.ComHeavy Media Gravity Separation Heavy media gravity separation involves using a mixture of fine media material,such as magnetite (SG 5.1) or ferrosilicon (SG 6.8),suspended in a slurry of water,to produce a media slurry with a specific gravity that will allow low density material(s) to float,and other high density material(s) to sink.

## Heavy Media Separation Process (ferrosilicon) DMS Powders
Heavy Media Separation Process.Dense Medium Separation (also called Heavy Media Separation) is a well established density separation process.Dense Medium Separation (DMS) uses the characteristic differences in density of the input material to enact a gravimetric based separation.Due to the robustness of the process,DMS can be used in the.heavy medium separation process iron oreHeavy Media Gravity Separation.Other areas where heavy media systems are used include iron ores,zinc,garnet,magnesite,lead and fluorspar.The cost of heavy media systems is more than that of tables of jigs,but is has a much finer degree of separation and can process a wide range of particle sizes.

heavy media.The separation by density occurs in the cyclone,with denser particles reporting to the cyclone underflow and less dense particles reporting to the cyclone overflow.The density of the separation is controlled by adjusting the ratio of water to medium in the suspension.Both floats and sinks products pass over a medium recovery screen.Heavy media gravity separation with Magnetite LKAB Minerals®Heavy media gravity separation means separating products with different densities.Magnetiteand water are used to make a slurry on which one product will float (the product with a lower density than the slurry) and in which the other product will sink (the product with a higher density than the slurry).Hence the term sink and float separation.
