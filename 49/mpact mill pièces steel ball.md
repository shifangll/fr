## How ball bearing is made manufacture,making,used.
Almost all parts of all ball bearings are made of steel.Since the bearing has to stand up to a lot of stress,it needs to be made of very strong steel.A die is made up of two pieces of steel that fit together,with a hole the shape of the finished part carved inside.When the cage is put in between and the die is closed,the cage is bent.Carbide End Mill Sets McMaster CarrFor longer tool life and a better finish in general purpose milling applications,these solid carbide end mills are harder,stronger,and more wear resistant than high speed steel and cobalt steel end mills.Their extreme hardness means they are brittle,so a highly rigid setup,such as a CNC machine,is necessary to prevent the end mill from breaking.They have a ball end for milling rounded.
